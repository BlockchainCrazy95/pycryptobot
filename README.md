## Supporting The Project

I get paid to write on Medium. Readers following me, applauding and commenting on my articles, all helps with my earnings. I provided this bot to all of you for free and actively develop it. One way you can support my efforts is to follow me on Medium and chap my articles. The Medium subscription is $5 a month (roughly Â£3) so basically nothing in terms of the value you are getting from the bot. Your efforts there would be greatly appreciated!
